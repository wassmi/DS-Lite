# DS-Lite

A Simple, Single-File Multi-AI Agent System for Data Science
Welcome to DS-Lite, a lightweight yet powerful multi-AI agent system designed to simplify your data science workflows. With just one Python file, DS-Lite empowers you to analyze, visualize, and gain insights from your data using a team of specialized AI agents. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, DS-Lite makes data science accessible, efficient, and fun! 


## What is DS-Lite?

DS-Lite is a single-file Python system that integrates multiple AI agents to automate and streamline data science tasks. Each agent has a specific role, from understanding your dataset to generating analysis plans, writing code, and executing it. It’s designed to be simple to use, yet powerful enough to handle complex data science workflows. 

## Key Features

Single-File Simplicity: Everything you need is in one Python file. No complex setups or dependencies.

Multi-Agent System: A team of AI agents work together to:

Understand your dataset.

Suggest relevant analyses.

Plan step-by-step workflows.

Generate executable Python code.

Execute and visualize results.

Supports Multiple Data Formats: Works with CSV, JSON, and SQLite files.

Dynamic & Adaptable: Automatically adapts to your dataset’s structure without hardcoding.

Visual-Focused: Generates stunning visualizations and saves them for easy sharing.

Lightweight & Fast: Minimal dependencies, optimized for quick setup and execution.

## How It Works
**Load Your Data**: Provide a CSV, JSON, or SQLite file.

**Data Understanding Agent**: Analyzes your dataset and suggests relevant analyses.

**Planning Agent**: Creates a detailed step-by-step plan for the selected analysis.

**Coding Agent**: Generates Python code to execute the plan.

**Execution Engine**: Runs the code and saves visual outputs.

**Results**: Explore the generated visualizations.


## Usage

1. Clone or download the run.py file.
2. Install requirements.txt
3. Replace the file_path variable in the main() function with your dataset file (CSV, JSON, or SQLite).
4. Run the script: python run.py
